# GDG_Hackathon
GDG X Sanskar X GWICS X Salesforce Hackathon 2025.
In this hackathon an assistant chatbot was created to help students at NJIT pick their classes for the upcoming semester. The technologies involved in this project include the Google Gemini API, React, MongoDB and Selenium for webscraping.
This group was actually the winner of this hackathon as our concept proved to have the most potential use to aid students!!!
